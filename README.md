# Jointly Personalized Sparse Hashing (JPSH)
The demo of our TOMM paper "Binary Representation via Jointly Personalized Sparse Hashing".

Existing hashing methods lack satisfactory performance in dealing with real-world scenarios that produce similar features with different semantic information. To address this challenge, we proposed an unsupervised method, namely Jointly Personalized Sparse Hashing (JPSH), for binary representation learning. It constructs a seamless hash function, which consists of twofold properties: semantic and pairwise similarities. JPSH accommodated the proposed Personalized Sparse Hashing (PSH) module to maintain semantic similarity and preserves pairwise similarity using a manifold-based hashing method. Thus, we learn discriminative binary codes by combining the two similarities. The framework is shown in the following figure.
